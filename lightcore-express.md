# Lightcore-Express VPN Protocol Investigation

This file is dedicated to the investigation and analysis of the Lightcore-Express VPN protocol. The aim is to understand its workings, security implications, and potential improvements.

## Design
**Lightweight and Efficient:** Lightway is designed to be a lightweight and efficient VPN protocol. This means minimal code complexity and resource usage, which translates to faster performance and reduced battery consumption on devices.

**Security:** The design emphasizes security, employing modern cryptographic techniques to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. It aims to provide a secure communication channel that is resistant to various types of attacks.

**Simplicity:** The protocol is designed to be simple, both in terms of configuration and deployment. This simplicity helps in maintaining the code and ensuring fewer bugs and vulnerabilities.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Lightway aims to be compatible across different platforms, including various operating systems and devices. This broad compatibility ensures that users can benefit from the protocol regardless of their device or operating system.

**Reliability and Stability:** The design prioritizes reliable and stable connections. It includes mechanisms to handle network changes and disruptions seamlessly, ensuring continuous connectivity for users.

## Implementation

**Core Protocol Logic:** This is implemented in C for performance reasons. The core logic handles the establishment, maintenance, and teardown of VPN connections.

**Cryptographic Operations:** Implementations of cryptographic algorithms used in the protocol, ensuring secure data transmission. This includes encryption, decryption, and key exchange mechanisms.

**Platform Abstractions:** Abstraction layers that handle platform-specific operations, such as network I/O, threading, and system calls. This ensures the core protocol logic remains platform-independent.
