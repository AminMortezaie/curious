# Virtual Private Networks in the Quantum Era: A Security in Depth Approach

Conventional asymmetric cryptography is threatened by the ongoing development of quantum computers. A
mandatory countermeasure in the context of virtual private networks (VPNs) is to use post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as a drop-in replacement for the authenticated key exchange in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
protocol.

## Conclusion

The development of quantum computers threatens current VPN cryptographic methods. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a mandatory countermeasure, but it is still under scrutiny. The article proposes combining PQC with quantum key distribution (QKD) and multipath key reinforcement (MKR) for enhanced security. The proposed solution includes a lightweight proxy for IKE packets, using all available symmetric keys to create a cryptographic tunnel. This ensures that even if PQC is compromised, the VPN remains secure.
