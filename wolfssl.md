### How WolfSSL Works

WolfSSL operates by providing a library of functions that applications can use to establish secure communication channels. Here is an overview of how WolfSSL works:

#### 1. Initialization

Before using WolfSSL functions, the library must be initialized. This involves setting up the necessary contexts and configurations.

```c
#include <wolfssl/ssl.h>

// Initialize WolfSSL library
wolfSSL_Init();
```

#### 2. SSL Context Setup

An SSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) holds configuration settings and information needed for SSL/TLS connections. Applications create and configure this context based on their requirements.

```c
// Create and configure SSL context
WOLFSSL_CTX* ctx = wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_2_client_method());

// Set context options (e.g., cipher suites, certificates)
wolfSSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, WOLFSSL_OP_NO_SSLv3);
```

#### 3. SSL/TLS Session Establishment

To establish a secure session, applications create an SSL object (`WOLFSSL`) from the context. This object is used to manage the SSL/TLS session, including handshaking, encryption, and data transfer.

```c
// Create SSL object from context
WOLFSSL* ssl = wolfSSL_new(ctx);

// Associate SSL object with a socket (e.g., a TCP socket)
wolfSSL_set_fd(ssl, sockfd);
```

#### 4. Handshaking

The SSL/TLS handshake process involves exchanging cryptographic information between the client and server to establish a secure session. This includes certificate verification, key exchange, and session key derivation.

```c
// Perform SSL/TLS handshake
if (wolfSSL_connect(ssl) != SSL_SUCCESS) {
    // Handle handshake error
    int err = wolfSSL_get_error(ssl, 0);
    // Error handling logic
}
```

#### 5. Data Transfer

Once the handshake is complete, applications can securely send and receive data using the established SSL/TLS session.

```c
// Send data securely
const char* msg = "Hello, secure world!";
wolfSSL_write(ssl, msg, strlen(msg));

// Receive data securely
char buffer[256];
int bytes = wolfSSL_read(ssl, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
// Handle received data
```

#### 6. Connection Termination

After the data transfer is complete, the SSL/TLS session can be terminated, and the resources associated with the SSL object and context can be freed.

```c
// Terminate SSL/TLS session
wolfSSL_shutdown(ssl);

// Free SSL object
wolfSSL_free(ssl);

// Free SSL context
wolfSSL_CTX_free(ctx);

// Cleanup WolfSSL library
wolfSSL_Cleanup();
```

### Key Functions and Concepts in WolfSSL

1. **wolfSSL_Init()**:
   - Initializes the WolfSSL library. Must be called before any other WolfSSL functions.

2. **wolfSSL_CTX_new()**:
   - Creates a new SSL context with a specified method (e.g., client or server, SSL/TLS version).

3. **wolfSSL_new()**:
   - Creates a new SSL object for managing an SSL/TLS session.

4. **wolfSSL_set_fd()**:
   - Associates an SSL object with a file descriptor (e.g., a socket).

5. **wolfSSL_connect()**:
   - Performs the SSL/TLS handshake for a client.

6. **wolfSSL_accept()**:
   - Performs the SSL/TLS handshake for a server.

7. **wolfSSL_write()**:
   - Sends data securely over the SSL/TLS session.

8. **wolfSSL_read()**:
   - Receives data securely over the SSL/TLS session.

9. **wolfSSL_shutdown()**:
   - Terminates the SSL/TLS session.

10. **wolfSSL_free()**:
    - Frees the SSL object.

11. **wolfSSL_CTX_free()**:
    - Frees the SSL context.
