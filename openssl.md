### Overall Design of OpenSSL

OpenSSL is designed as a modular and flexible library, providing both high-level and low-level APIs for cryptographic operations and secure communications.

1. **Library Structure**:
   - **libcrypto**: The core cryptographic library providing low-level cryptographic algorithms and utilities.
   - **libssl**: The library implementing SSL/TLS protocols using the underlying cryptographic functions from libcrypto.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Contexts**: SSL_CTX and SSL objects manage the state and configuration of SSL/TLS connections.
   - **Sessions**: SSL sessions are used to resume previous connections for efficiency.
   - **Certificates**: Functions for handling X.509 certificates, including parsing, validation, and chain building.
   - **Cipher Suites**: Configurable sets of cryptographic algorithms used for secure communication.

3. **Typical Workflow**:
   - **Initialization**: Initialize the library and create SSL_CTX for configuring SSL/TLS settings.
   - **Context Configuration**: Configure the SSL_CTX with certificates, private keys, cipher suites, and other settings.
   - **Connection Setup**: Create SSL objects for each connection and associate them with network sockets.
   - **Handshake**: Perform the SSL/TLS handshake to establish secure communication channels.
   - **Data Transfer**: Use SSL_read and SSL_write for encrypted data transfer.
   - **Shutdown**: Properly shut down the connection and free resources.

### Example Workflow in Code

Here is a simplified example of using OpenSSL to establish an SSL/TLS connection:

```c
#include <openssl/ssl.h>
#include <openssl/err.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize OpenSSL
    SSL_library_init();
    SSL_load_error_strings();
    OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms();

    // Create SSL context
    const SSL_METHOD *method = SSLv23_client_method();
    SSL_CTX *ctx = SSL_CTX_new(method);

    // Load certificates and private key
    SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file(ctx, "client-cert.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);
    SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, "client-key.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);

    // Create SSL object
    SSL *ssl = SSL_new(ctx);

    // Create a socket and connect to the server
    int server = create_socket("hostname", 443);
    SSL_set_fd(ssl, server);

    // Perform the handshake
    if (SSL_connect(ssl) == -1) {
        ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
    } else {
        printf("Connected with %s encryption\n", SSL_get_cipher(ssl));
        // Communicate securely
    }

    // Clean up
    SSL_free(ssl);
    close(server);
    SSL_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_cleanup();

    return 0;
}
```
