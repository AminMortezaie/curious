### Libraries in Solidity: An Overview

A **library** in Solidity is a piece of reusable code that can be used by smart contracts. It helps in organizing the codebase and allows functions to be shared among multiple contracts. Libraries are similar to contracts, but with some important differences, particularly in terms of state, inheritance, and deployment.

Hereâ€™s a detailed look at libraries in Solidity:

### Main Features and Benefits of Libraries

1. **Statelessness**:
   - Libraries cannot hold or manage state (i.e., they cannot have state variables). They only provide functionality that works with data passed to them or the state of the calling contract. This makes libraries ideal for utility functions, such as mathematical operations, string manipulations, or working with custom data structures like the ones in your `Tick` and `Position` examples.
   
2. **Gas Efficiency**:
   - Libraries can save gas because, if marked as `internal`, the code is simply embedded into the calling contract (inlining). This avoids the need for extra contract calls.
   - Alternatively, libraries can be deployed separately, and other contracts can link to them using `external` calls, allowing multiple contracts to share the same library code, reducing deployment costs for large systems.
   
3. **Code Reusability**:
   - Libraries allow developers to encapsulate commonly used functions or operations that can be reused across multiple contracts, reducing redundancy in the code.
   - For example, in DeFi protocols like Uniswap, libraries are often used for operations like liquidity calculations, handling of tick ranges, or handling complex arithmetic operations on large numbers.

4. **No Inheritance**:
   - Libraries do not support inheritance. You cannot inherit from a library in the same way you can with contracts. Libraries are meant to be modular, standalone pieces of code that can be imported and used by contracts.

5. **No Ether Transfers**:
   - Libraries cannot receive Ether (funds), and they cannot hold balances like contracts can. They only serve to provide functions for data manipulation or logic.

### Syntax and Usage

There are two ways a library can be used by a contract:

1. **Direct Call**:
   When you call a function from a library directly, it behaves like a normal function call. For example:
   ```solidity
   library MathLib {
       function add(uint a, uint b) internal pure returns (uint) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   contract MyContract {
       function sum(uint x, uint y) public pure returns (uint) {
           return MathLib.add(x, y); // Direct call to a library function
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Using `using for`**:
   Libraries can be attached to specific types using the `using for` directive. This allows you to call library functions as if they are methods of the type being extended:
   ```solidity
   library MathLib {
       function double(uint a) internal pure returns (uint) {
           return a * 2;
       }
   }

   contract MyContract {
       using MathLib for uint; // Extend uint with the double function
       
       function getDouble(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {
           return x.double(); // x.double() is syntactic sugar for MathLib.double(x)
       }
   }
   ```

### Deployment Options

1. **Inline Libraries** (Internal Functions):
   - If the functions in a library are marked as `internal`, their code is copied directly into the contract during compilation, just like functions within the contract itself. This makes the library code more gas-efficient since no external calls are required.
   
2. **Linked Libraries** (External Functions):
   - If the functions in a library are marked as `public` or `external`, the library can be deployed separately, and the contract that uses it will reference the library via an external call. This is useful when multiple contracts need to share the same library, avoiding duplicate code.

### Example of a Library in Use

Consider a simple example of a mathematical library that handles safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow:

```solidity
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");
        return c;
    }

    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b <= a, "SafeMath: subtraction underflow");
        return a - b;
    }
}

contract Token {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(amount);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `SafeMath` library provides functions for safe addition and subtraction to prevent overflows/underflows.
- The `Token` contract uses `SafeMath` to handle balance operations safely. The `using for` directive is employed to extend `uint256` with `add` and `sub` methods.

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Libraries** are a way to write reusable, modular, and stateless code that can be shared across contracts.
2. **Stateless**: They do not store state or handle Ether.
3. **Efficient**: Libraries can reduce gas costs through code reusability and reduced contract size.
4. **Utility-focused**: Ideal for mathematical operations, data structures, and logic-heavy tasks that do not need to persist data.
5. **Two call types**: Functions can be either `internal` (inlined in the contract) or `external` (requiring a call to the library).
